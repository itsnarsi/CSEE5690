\section{Introduction}
In this paper we forecast CPU usage by five different virtual machines by using different such as movine average (MA), weighted moving average (WMA), exponential smootheing(ES), and exponential smoothening with trend (EST). Along with these basic methods, we also test modified EST with weighted moving average for updating $F_t$ and peicewise regression models.

To test the performance of the forecasting methods we used tracking signal ratio (TS). Traking signal is the ratio of cumulative sum of forecasting signals to the mean absolute deviation. Which indicates the presents of bias in the results produced by the forecast model.

\begin{equation}
TS = \frac{\sum A_t - F_t}{MAD}
\end{equation}

Where $A_t$ is the actual value, $F_t$ is predicted value and MAD is the mean absolute deviation.

\begin{equation}
MAD = \frac{\sum |A_t - F_t|}{n}
\end{equation}

For a better forcasting model, TS should be not grater than 4 and not less than -4.
\begin{equation}
-4 < TS < +4 
\end{equation}

If traking singal value is out the limits, then the forecating model should be re-evaluated. If the TS above 4, most of our predictions as above actual values and vice versa.


\section{Forecasting Techniques}


\subsection{Moving Average (MA)}

\subsection{Weighted Moving Average (WMA)}

\subsection{Exponential Smoothening (ES)}

\subsection{Exponential Smoothening with Trend (EST)}

\subsection{Windowed Exponential Smoothening with Trend (WEST)}

\subsection{Peicewise regression (PR)}

\section{Results}

1) Show the frequency data for all five VM's

2) For each forecasting method talk about the results

3) Finally select the most varying VM's and show all the different methods performance.

\section{Conclusion}

Talk about what we just wrote in this paper.
